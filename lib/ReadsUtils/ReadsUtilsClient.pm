=item Description

Input to the validateFASTQ function.

    Required parameters:
    file_path - the path to the file to validate.
    
    Optional parameters:
    interleaved - whether the file is interleaved or not. Setting this to
        true disables sequence ID checks.

=head2 UploadReadsParams

=over 4



=item Description

Input to the upload_reads function.

Required parameters:
fwd_id - the id of the shock node containing the reads data file:
    either single end reads, forward/left reads, or interleaved reads.
sequencing_tech - the sequencing technology used to produce the
    reads.

One of:
wsid - the id of the workspace where the reads will be saved
    (preferred).
wsname - the name of the workspace where the reads will be saved.

One of:
objid - the id of the workspace object to save over
name - the name to which the workspace object will be saved
    
Optional parameters:
rev_id - the shock node id containing the reverse/right reads for
    paired end, non-interleaved reads.
single_genome - whether the reads are from a single genome or a
    metagenome. Default is single genome.
strain - information about the organism strain
    that was sequenced.
source - information about the organism source.
interleaved - specify that the fwd reads file is an interleaved paired
    end reads file as opposed to a single end reads file. Default true,
    ignored if rev_id is specified.
read_orientation_outward - whether the read orientation is outward
    from the set of primers. Default is false and is ignored for
    single end reads.
insert_size_mean - the mean size of the genetic fragments. Ignored for
    single end reads.
insert_size_std_dev - the standard deviation of the size of the
    genetic fragments. Ignored for single end reads.
